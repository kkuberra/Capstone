## About

Jump Shot is full stack mobile app made with React Native,
Native Base, and Expo. The backend was created with Node.JS, 
Express, Knex.JS, PSQL and Heroku. This application works with
the Fantasy Data API Solutions library to let you select NBA players
from any team to view their stats through visual charts from the
2017 -18 season.
You can also add and delete players from a favorites list.
